# React Tic-Tac-Toe Interview Assignment

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using **React** and **TypeScript**. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate proficiency in React component development, TypeScript integration, and writing unit tests using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.

## Features

- A fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with interactive UI.
- Modular and reusable React components.
- TypeScript types for enhanced type safety.
- Unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building the UI.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static type-checking.
- **Vitest**: A fast unit testing framework.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd React-tic-tac-toe-interview-assignment
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
4. Run the test cases:
    ```bash
   npm run test

### Test Cases

Unit tests are written for all major components and functionality, including:

- Rendering an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Handling player interactions and state updates.
- Validating game logic and outcomes

Run the following command to execute the test suite:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
   
# Notes

During the development of this project, all core features and test cases were implemented. However, the test suite currently has some failing test cases, which will require further debugging and fixes.
